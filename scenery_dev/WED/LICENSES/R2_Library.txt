 R2_Library for X-Plane 10
  Version 2 (27.2.2016)
---------------------------

Installation
------------
UNPACK archive to Custom scenery (it would by looks like this - XPLroot/Custom Scenery/R2_Library)

Notes
-----
- Switch to WINTER TREE textures
	rename file textures/R2_trees.dds to textures/R2_trees-summer.dds for example
	rename file textures/R2_trees-zimni.png to textures/R2_trees.png
	For summer rename it back.
- WIND TURBINES is recomended to place by propeller to the north. Heading is 180. Turbine will rotate to true wind direction. For wind turbine fields I recommend to use autogen so turbine will not rotate same speed. Heigth of turbine is including propeller. For 100m turbine is true heigth of generator 80m.
- COOLING TOWERS have autogen too, some of them will smoke
